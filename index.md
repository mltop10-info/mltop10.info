## Overview

The primary aim of of the OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10 project is to
deliver an overview of the top 10 security issues of machine learning systems.
As such, a major goal of this project is to develop a high quality deliverable,
reviewed by industry peers.

## Target Audience

The primary audience for the deliverables in this project are developers,
machine learning engineering and operational practitioners, and application
security experts. While each of these roles build, operate and secure machine
learning systems, the content is not aimed to be exclusively at them. The
content will aim to specify where appropriate the level of understanding
required for specific technology domains.

## Scope

This project will provide an overview of the top 10 security issues of machine
learning systems. Due to the rapid adoption of machine learning systems, there
are related projects within OWASP and other organisations, that may have
narrower or broader scope than this project. As an example, while adversarial
attacks is a category of threats, this project will also cover non-adversarial
scenarios, such as security hygiene of machine learning operational and
engineering workflows.
